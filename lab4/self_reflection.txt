All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: resize function and calling existing functions reduce a lot of work.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I used 2 different ways to do resize.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: nothing

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: isEmpty can use just one sigle line.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: nothing

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: nothing

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: better ways to implement removelast/removefirst using size.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I didnt use sentinel node.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Didnt add edge cases for recursive get.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: isEmpty has 1-line implementation

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: 

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: nothing

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: I think this session is purely waste of time.
